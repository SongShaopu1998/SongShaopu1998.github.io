My name is Shaopu Song. I'm an incoming EECS M.Eng student at UC Berkeley. Before that, I was an undergraduate student as Southeast University, majoring in Robotics Engineering.

Due to the **COVID-19** pandemic, I chose to defer my enrollment to Berkeley from Fall 2021 to Fall 2022. Another reason of deferral is that I am not so obsessed with what I have learned in the past four years, which includes Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics Vision… Almost all of the time I have spent from my sophomore year to my senior year is using **Python** to implement and then observe the above tricks by leveraging some libraries and NN models. 

So I decided to make some changes. During this deferring period, I learned from some famous Open-source CS courses and try to lay a solid foundation of computer science knowledge including **Data Structures and Algorithms**, **Advanced C++**, **Computer Architecture**…

The ones I have finished learning (lectures & projects & labs) include: 
  - **Berkeley CS 61A (Fall 2020)** ✔️ **Videos** ✔️ **Discs** ✔️ **Labs** ✔️ **Hws** ✔️ **Projs**
  - **Stanford CS 106X  (Winter 2017 & Autumn 2018)** ✔️ **Videos (Win17)** ✔️ **Discs (Fa18)** ✔️ **Assignments (Win17 & Fa18)**
  - **UIUC CS 225 (Fall 2020)** ✔️ **Videos**
  - **Stanford CS 106L (Autumn 2019)** ✔️ **Videos** ✔️ **Discs** ✔️ **Assignments (with the 2020 Spring final project version)**
  - **Berkeley CS 61C (Fall 2021)** ✔️ **Videos** ✔️ **Discs** ✔️ **Labs (with Fa20 lab10 & lab11)** ✔️ **Projs (with Fa20 proj4)**

🔭 I’m currently working on **CS 170**, also, **Leetcode** (lol...). And hope to finish learning most of the **CS 15445 (Database)** contents before beginning my graduate study. As for some other great courses such as **CS 162** and **mit 6.824**, I have to reach them later. All the labs/hws/projs I have ever done in these courses are kept as **Private Repositories** on **Github**.
